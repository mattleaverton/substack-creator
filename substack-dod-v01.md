# Substack Creator Newsletter Engine — Definition of Done

## Scope

### In Scope
- Pure React frontend (no backend) for brand-driven Substack content creation
- Client-side Gemini LLM integration (gemini-3-flash-preview, gemini-3.1-pro-preview w/ extended thinking, gemini-2.5-flash-lite for tests)
- IndexedDB persistence for config, drafts, sessions, and post history
- Setup flow: API key, company, voice, guardrails
- Dashboard with post history, drafts, and navigation
- Trending Topics with search-grounded research and synthesized prompts
- New Post pipeline: Topic → Research → Outline → Write/Edit/Guardrails → Complete
- Demo mode: replay cached sessions with prefilled UI; ships with one bundled P&G session
- Production mode: record all sessions for later replay
- Structured JSON output with retry/backoff for all LLM calls
- Integration tests (canned data), smoke tests (live gemini-2.5-flash-lite), manual test option (real models)
- Deployment readiness artifacts for GitHub -> Railway, validated via code review
- Explicit non-deployment policy for acceptance: no live deploy execution
- Visual design matching Substack look and feel

### Out of Scope
- Backend server or API layer
- Multi-company workspace support (v01 is single workspace)
- RAG or document retrieval beyond search grounding
- Manual pause/edit/rerun controls between Write/Edit/Guardrails cycles
- Substack API publishing integration
- Executing a live deployment to Railway (or any hosting platform) during DoD verification

### Assumptions
- User has a valid Gemini API key
- Browser supports IndexedDB
- A reviewer can inspect deployment configuration/docs to validate deployability
- Node.js/npm toolchain available for build and test

## Deliverables

| Artifact | Location | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| React application | `src/` | Complete SPA source code |
| Build output | `dist/` or `build/` | Production-ready static assets |
| Bundled demo session | `src/demo/` or equivalent | Canned P&G session data (config + post) for out-of-box demo mode |
| Test suite | `src/__tests__/` or colocated | Integration tests (canned), smoke tests (live gemini-2.5-flash-lite) |
| Browser test evidence bundle | `.ai/test-evidence/latest/` | Scenario evidence artifacts plus manifest mapping each `IT-*` to status and artifact paths/types |
| Deployment config | `railway.json` / `Procfile` or equivalent | GitHub -> Railway deployment-ready config and docs, validated by review only (not executed) |
| `package.json` | project root | Dependencies, scripts for build, test, dev |

## Evidence Contract

- Test runs must write `.ai/test-evidence/latest/manifest.json`.
- Manifest must include one entry per executed `IT-*` scenario, with:
  - scenario ID
  - pass/fail status
  - artifact list (path + artifact type)
  - short summary of key assertions
- UI scenarios (`IT-2` through `IT-8`, `IT-11`, `IT-12`) require screenshots.
- Browser scenarios must include trace/log artifacts that capture console errors/unhandled exceptions (or explicit `none` when absent).
- Failing scenarios must still emit best-effort artifacts and a failing manifest entry.
- Exit code alone is insufficient evidence for browser acceptance.
